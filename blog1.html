        I had first noticed the term SEO when I was working on MSN search engine refinement project in the year 2006. I had decided to learn about it as it was quite a new term then.
    </p>
    <p>
        Nothing worked out as planned and today I have a crazy career path. But I don't regret it any way. I enjoyed whatever jobs happened to me.
    </p>
    <p>Internet and social media gave me an opportunity to be connected with digital media and marketing enthusiasts in some way, though never active.</p>
    <p>I was looking for an affordable course on digital marketing but in vain. I checked almost every online learning platform like Udemy, Lynda, Udacity etc but was not convinced. One day I received a mail regarding the Internship program and when he revealed the price of the course I was more than happy to know that finally after all these long years wait, I would be learning the tricks and tools.</p>
    <p>The first session of the internship program was exciting. The introduction was interesting and inviting. The catch line was "Best students will get to work on live projects." Another thing that I find exciting is the opportunity to earn back the internship fee by submitting well-done projects in a timely manner. Alas! I have a habit of procrastination.</p>
    <p>So the class started and we discussed "finding the gold". It's all about understanding market opportunities and how one to work towards achieving one's goals in that particular market. One should study the existing market needs and create products and services which fits those market needs. Market needs are never-ending and one need generates more needs. One has to be alert enough to tap the market opportunities.</p>
    <p>As per me, "Niche" is a comfortable position in life. I had not paid much attention to the adjective version earlier which I got to know during the discussion in the session. So it goes like this: a niche is a product, service or interest that appeal to a small, specialised section of the population. Digital marketing is a niche, it is a product or service which is helpful in improving ROI in the online market space. While selecting a niche for self, one should consider talent, passion and market opportunity. Three major niches are money, health and relationship.</p>
    <p>A small section on global economics was also interesting. It was mentioned that the economy of a country goes up when the average age of the country goes up. People spend more. The economy goes down when the average age goes up above 50, household spending goes down. I don't relate to this idea much. There might be much research done on this but it doesn't go down well with me. I am naïve in economics now so maybe I will counter it in my coming posts. Stay tuned ;)</p>
    <p>The key basic skill for a digital marketing person is "Communication". Communication not only involves sending across your ideas, thoughts and views but it also involves listening. One should listen to what people want, what are their needs and then proceed to the next step of delivering the product/services. And once the product/service is in the market, it has to be conveyed to the audience that the product/service is of good value (sales skill). So communication plays a key role in digital marketing same as in offline marketing.</p>
    <p>Digital marketing is the trend of the season and it's not going to fade away soon. Due to high Internet and mobile penetration, we can see changes in consumer behaviour. You just need to keep finding out new ways to get the attention of the population towards your product/services. Even automation doesn't pose any threat. There are a few limitations when we talk about the robots and automation like sensing the need of the population and thus digital marketing is here to stay.</p>
    <h3>What is Integrated Digital Marketing?</h3>
    <p>There are a few components of integrated digital marketing like Content, Email, Paid Advertising, SEO and Social Media.</p>
    <p>IDM starts with content marketing. Content is the foundation of everything on the internet. Content helps in building trust and educating the customer about the product and services. This content could be shared on social media to get more visibility. Search engine picks up the product from there and starts driving traffic to the content. Once traffic starts coming to the content email marketing could be started and traffic could be diverted back to the same content. This works like a machine and traffic starts circulating. Once the product is visible and starts selling and converting the available budget could be invested in paid advertising. So the process works like a machine.</p>
