<h3>Marketing is about good conversation</h3>
<p>Marketing is all about conveying your product/services to the population. But the communication would be successful only when one is authentic and true. Being authentic garners the audience's attention and trust which in turn helps in spreading the product/service to a broader audience.</p>
<h3>Who is a better marketer?</h3>
<p>A good marketer is a person who has travelled a lot, learnt new languages, learnt about people, their life and culture and does new things all the time. This is said because people with more experience are better marketers.</p>
<h3>How to define your target customer</h3>
<p>A marketer cannot communicate with the entire population as it is said "If everyone is your audience then no one is your audience." A marketer needs to work out a niche and decide the exact audience type. When a marketer has to communicate with the population she has to decide her audience based on demography and psychography.</p>
<h4>Demographics-</h4>
<p>Demography is the statistical study of populations (age, location etc.)</p>
<h4>Psychographic -</h4>
<p>Psychographics is a qualitative methodology used to describe consumers on psychological attributes (interest, liking, fear etc.)</p>
<p>She should further filter this audience type to a single person which is known as a customer avatar. A customer avatar is a detailed profile of your ideal customer. It doesn't make assumptions or categorise people into groups. The avatar focuses on one person and outlines everything about them. It goes into much greater depth than a regular marketing persona, providing marketers with many more targeting tools.</p>
<p>Once the marketer has decided who her audience will be the next step is to initiate the communication. Though the selected audience will be huge, communication should happen in such a way that it appears like one to one communication. In today's digital world when marketing is being done online for consumers who are sitting alone with their devices, one to one communication becomes more effective. Communication should be carried out in such a way that the consumer feels the connection. The target consumer already has some need in their mind and a marketer has to understand that need and communicate. A marketer has to join the mental conversation of the consumer, try to influence without creating a new conversation. In essence, communication should be done in such a way that it should appear that you are writing to one person with a specific need or problem. Thus, Email and direct messaging act as a powerful medium of communication in digital marketing.</p>
<p>A survey form with an interesting questionnaire helps in building an avatar. When building an avatar, plenty of questions should be asked beyond the consumer's relationship to your product or service. The consumer should be thoughtfully evaluated based on different aspects.</p>
<p>An avatar helps a marketer in many ways.</p>
<p>· A marketer starts viewing the prospect as a real person.</p>
<p>· The target market is narrowed down which allows us to target them more effectively.</p>
<p>· Content and services could be tailored in such a way that will appeal to a specific customer base and make more effective impacts.</p>
<p>Once the customer avatar is built, giving it a name is a next step though not mandatory. This makes the customer avatar easy to remember and understand who you're striving to attract.</p>
